- As a dedicated reader I would like to be able to login in order to make my support known and post comments and opinions (must have)
- As one of the people writing for the site I would like to also login and update through the site in order to not have to go through the owner everything (should have)
- As the admin, I would like different privileges and permissions between the people logging in as movie reviewers and normal people just commenting (admin, film critic, film maker, user, anonym) (must have)
- As a user I would like all my login data to be safe in order to protect my personal data (should have)
- As the admin I would like to block various users and IDs in order to prevent trolling and abuse (should have)
- As the admin I would like to secure a donation system in order to make the site financially viable (nice to have)
- As an user, I would like to be notified when my account has been approved (should have)
